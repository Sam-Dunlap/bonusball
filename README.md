# bonusball
a fun jaunt in learning javascript

This page should run fine with no additional installations necessary.

You can use this project to look at, show little kids, and so on! It's a simple program that allows you to create as many randomly colored balls as you like. The balls will
bounce around within a confined space, colliding with walls.

Future iterations will include adjustable physics sliders, allowing you to control gravity and friction. I also intend to implement collision detection between balls as a toggled feature.

For support requests, you can find me on Twitter @SDunlapWebDev . I'm still learning, but I'll do my best to keep this and other programs up to date and bug-free.
